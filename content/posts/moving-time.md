At the end of march, I'll be moving to Japan with the goal of connecting with my ancestry 🎉.

It's been a long time coming, but I'm finally happy to announce that I'm moving to Japan 🎉. I'm really excited and scared to finally say it, but it's time for a new adventure.

**I'm moving in hopes of connecting with my ancestry** (I'm half Japanese) either by talking to my existing relatives or living in their culture.

My other main goal is **to improve my Japanese abilities** with the goal of fluency 👍.

That's a super brief summary, but I'll be posting a more detailed explanation soon.
