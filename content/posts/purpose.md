When I tell people about that I want to learn Japanese so that I can speak with my relatives and connect with my ancestry, the reaction I always get is “wow you’re such a good person for caring about family.”  But I’m not pursuing Japanese for them, I’m pursuing it for my myself. To me, I have the luxury of having different ancestry than most of my peers. I am very lucky to have relatives still alive in another country. I see it as having a rare opportunity to connect with my ancestry. It’s something that I can do that is authentic; it’s a path that I was born into and could not have sequestered in any other way. I’m not good or bad, just lucky.

My identity in Canada has always been Japanese through the lens of a Canadian. Canadian doesn’t mean being white, but what has distinguished me ethnically from my peers has been my Japanese heritage. I embody all the manners and motions of any Canadian, but there’s also a part of me that wanted to be unique from my peers (perhaps so I stand out and receive attention).  When I was a kid my asian identity was that conduit to being unique, at least to compared to my friends. I foolishly had a narrative in my head that could be summarized as: “I’m not normal like everyone else. I have this Japanese side that makes me different. Let me show why I’m unique so that you’ll like me.” The irony is that Canada is already a place full of people from different heritages and I am no more special than the next person.

When I’m in Japan I actually have the opposite experience. All of a sudden no one knows I’m Japanese and I stick out as a foreigner immediately. Instead of standing out, all I want to do is blend in. But the way I dress and the way I walk is a dead give away. I’m not as discreet as everyone else in the train. I don’t blend into the background like the people around me do. I immediately transition into being a foreigner. Oops.

I’ve always had one foot in the Canada and another in the Japan and my identity has never felt complete. I can only speak for my experience, but imagine having an entire half of your family that you can’t speak to. On New Years day we’d phone my Obaachan in Japan (my grandma) and say “happy new years” in Japanese and then immediately give the phone back to my mom (yes, we were also very shy).  For the majority of my life that has been the interaction with the Japanese side of my family. When we’d go to Japan then I’d of course participate, but my parents would always be around to interpret (thank you mom and dad). This gap also meant we were always being taken care of and looked after --  imposing a sort of responsibility onto my parents and relatives to make sure that my siblings and I were never confused or lost.  It meant we were by default in a position of being babysitted without a great way of returning the generosity. I want to close that gap so that I am not by default a burden.
