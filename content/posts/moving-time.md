At the end of march, I'll be moving to Japan with the goal of connecting with my ancestry 🎉.  It's something that's been in the works for years, but really my whole life.

I'm really excited and scared to finally say it, but it's time for a new adventure.

As I mentioned, **I'm moving in hopes of connecting with my ancestry** (I'm half Japanese). I'll pursue that either by talking to my existing relatives or living in their culture.

My other main goal is **to improve my Japanese abilities** with the goal of fluency 👍.

That's a super brief summary, but I'll be posting a more detailed explanation soon.
