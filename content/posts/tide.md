My first journal entry of 2019.

Exciting.

By the way, I am not a journal person.

As the date of my departure to Japan rolls near, I can’t help but think of all the things I’ll miss at home in Victoria. I’ve met a lot of wonderful people in here and had countless good memories. All I want to do right now is enjoy the island life a bit longer-- hold onto this life-setup that has taken me almost a decade to craft.

On that note, I find myself having a harder time studying Japanese. I realize that once I’ll be in Japan then I’ll have all the time in the world to study and so my priorities have temporarily shifted to life in Canada instead. I think I’m scared because who knows what will happen next (and I like my life here), but simultaneously there’s so much opportunity when presented with a blank canvas. Even more when presented with a challenge.

I haven’t booked my tickets for Japan yet.

Sigh.

I could stop here, save my money, and do something else. I think I find it all a bit paralyzing. The next steps I take will solidify a dream I’ve had for my whole life. It’s a dream that I’ve put aside for so long and supplemented with an amazing life in Canada. The older I get, the more I want to be available to my family here. My mom, my dad, and my siblings.

I’ve been rock climbing a lot recently (understatement) and as an analogy it feels like I’m approaching the crux of a bouldering problem. At least emotionally. The difficulty for me now is not the logistics, not the plan, not even the execution. It’s committing to all. I'm being over-dramatic.

People keep asking me “when are you going?” and I have some dates in mind, but nothing actually concrete. When I look back at this all then perhaps I’ll wonder why I worried so much.

I have that feeling when you stare off into the distance in deep thought. Not really paying attention to what I’m looking at. Maybe just gazing at the wall. And then all the background noise that's been around me the whole time suddenly comes to the forefront of my mind. And I realize where I am and that the city is waking up.
